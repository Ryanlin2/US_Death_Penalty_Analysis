Project Overview
This project examines the trends in death penalty executions across the United States between 1977 and 2023. Our goal was to investigate underlying factors that contribute to the likelihood of receiving the death penalty. Specifically, we explored how race, sex, region, and other demographic variables correlate with execution rates. Furthermore, we analyzed the role of political affiliation and trends over time to gain a deeper understanding of the systemic factors influencing the death penalty in the U.S.

Introduction
The death penalty has long been a controversial topic in the United States. This project aims to identify trends that influence death penalty outcomes by analyzing various factors such as race, sex, geographic location, and political affiliation. We also examine how the death penalty has evolved over time, looking at the peak execution rates around the year 2000 and the subsequent decline.

We focus on key variables, including the race and sex of both the convicted individuals and their victims, the region where the execution took place, and whether the individual volunteered for execution. This analysis aims to reveal potential biases and trends in death penalty sentencing and executions across the country.

Data Source
We utilized the Execution Database - U.S. Executions dataset, compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC). This dataset contains information on individuals executed in the U.S. from 1977 to 2023. The dataset includes:

Date of execution
Race and sex of the individual
Region and state of execution
Number of victims
Information on victims' race and sex
It is important to note that this dataset does not include individuals currently on death row, which could affect the overall conclusions of this analysis. The dataset focuses on 1566 individuals who have been executed, while over 2500 remain on death row.
